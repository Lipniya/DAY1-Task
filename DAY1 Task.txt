HTTP1 & HTTP2 Differents:
     
         HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
HTTP is a request -response protocol that allows users to communicate data on the World Wide Web and transfer hypertext.

HTTP 1:
     
         1Loads resources one after the other,so if one resource cannot be loaded it blocks all the other resource behind it.
         The uses works on the texual format.
         It uses requests resources inlining for use getting multiple pages.
         It compreses data by itself.

HTTP 2:

        In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
        It works on the binary protocol.
        It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
        It uses HPACK for data compression.
